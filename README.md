Linux OMAP Randconfig seeds

Why?
===

randconfig is meant to catch build issues - remember it may not always
mean a bootable kernel.

randconfig can be seeded with a file containing Kconfig symbols we
want to manually set on the randconfig. Many folks always start with
RMK's seeds which you can get from [1] and the ones in this repository
are based on those for OMAP2/3/4/5/etc.

Quick HOWTO on usage:
=================

Here is the simplest, crapiest script you can use (from the kernel
directory) for this:

	head=$(git describe)
	basedir="logs"

	for file in $(ls ../omap-seeds/*.config)
	do
		config=$(basename $file)
		DIR=$basedir/$head/$config
		for i in $(seq 1 5);
		do
			export ARCH="arm"
			export CROSS_COMPILE="arm-linux-"
			export KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG="$file"
			TDIR=$DIR/randconfig$i

			mkdir -p $TDIR

			make randconfig;
			cp .config $TDIR/defconfig;
			make 1> $TDIR/stdout.txt 2> $TDIR/stderr.txt
		done
	done
